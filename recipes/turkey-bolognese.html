                <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p1>In this recipe we will go over how to make a classic Italian dish the "Bolognese" substituting ground turkey instead of a more traditional ground beef or pork product. By using ground turkey we are able to both lower the fat content of the dish and have a meal that is kosher for all major religions.</p1>
